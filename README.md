# DistraAI

**Disaster intelligence before the crisis hits.**

DistraAI is a prototype dashboard for monitoring flood and landslide risk across Indian regions. It combines environmental signals — rainfall intensity, soil saturation, slope stability — into a single 0–100 risk score per zone, and presents the result through an interactive map, severity-tiered alerts, community ground reports, and a live responder chat room.

Built with **Next.js 16** (App Router), **React 19**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **Leaflet**. The live chat at `/chat` is backed by **Firebase** (Authentication + Cloud Firestore); everything else runs on bundled sample data with a clean seam for plugging in a real backend.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The entire dashboard works immediately with no configuration — risk data comes from bundled sample fixtures.

**To enable live chat** (optional):

```bash
# 1. Create a Firebase project with Google sign-in + Cloud Firestore enabled
# 2. Copy the config template and fill in your values
cp .env.example .env.local

# 3. Deploy the security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# 4. Restart the dev server (env vars are inlined at build time)
npm run dev
```

If you skip this, the chat page shows setup instructions instead of a broken sign-in button. The rest of the dashboard is completely unaffected.

```

### Data flow

The project has two separate data paths by design:

**Risk data** (dashboard, map, alerts, community, reports):

```
Component → useData(fetcher) → data-client.ts → mock-store / API route
```

Components never import fixtures directly — they call accessors on `data-client.ts`, which dispatches to the mock store or fetch-based API handlers depending on `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_PROVIDER`. The returned shapes match `src/data/types.ts`, so swapping to a real backend means reimplementing the same interface.

**Realtime chat** (`/chat` only):

```
ChatRoom → useAuth() → useChat(user) → Firestore onSnapshot
```

Chat is the one path that hits a real database. It uses Firebase Authentication for sign-in and Firestore's `onSnapshot` for live message delivery. This path is completely separate from `data-client.ts` and is documented in [docs/realtime.md](docs/realtime.md).

---

## Risk Scoring Engine

The scoring engine lives in [`src/lib/risk-summary.ts`](src/lib/risk-summary.ts). It is **rule-based**, not a machine learning model — every threshold is readable in one file.

Three factors are evaluated:

| Factor | Source | Thresholds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rainfall intensity** | `insights[id=rainfall].value` (mm) | ≥150 critical, ≥100 high, ≥60 moderate |
| **Soil moisture** | `insights[id=soil-saturation].value` (%) | ≥90 critical, ≥80 high, ≥60 moderate |
| **Slope stability** | Any landslide/combined zone at high/critical | Binary: unstable (high) or stable (low) |

The zone scores are averaged, mapped to a level (`low` < 40 ≤ `moderate` < 60 ≤ `high` < 80 ≤ `critical`), and returned as a `RiskSummary` with trend and confidence.

The same engine drives the gauge on the dashboard, the zone fills on the map, and the severity bars on the alert feed. Threshold changes must be accompanied by updates to [`src/lib/__tests__/risk-summary.test.ts`](src/lib/__tests__/risk-summary.test.ts).

See [docs/risk-scoring.md](docs/risk-scoring.md) for the full writeup.

## Live Chat & Firebase

`/chat` is backed by Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in) and Cloud Firestore. Messages are written to a `chat_messages` collection and delivered live to all connected users via Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener — no polling.

### Fail-soft design

The Firebase SDK is initialised **defensively**. `getAuth()` throws synchronously when `apiKey` is missing, and because `AuthProvider` is mounted in the root layout, an unguarded throw would crash every route. So when the config is incomplete:

- `firebase.ts` exports `null` for `auth` and `db`
- `AuthProvider` settles immediately in a signed-out state
- `useChat` skips the Firestore subscription
- `/chat` renders setup instructions instead of a broken sign-in button

A fresh clone with no `.env.local` renders the entire dashboard without errors.

### Security

Access control lives in [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules), not in the client:

- **Auth-gated reads** — only signed-in users can read messages
- **UID matching** — `request.resource.data.uid` must equal `request.auth.uid`
- **Content validation** — text must be a non-empty string ≤1000 chars, with a regex to reject whitespace-only bodies
- **Append-only** — messages cannot be edited or deleted
- **Deny-by-default** — everything not explicitly opened is denied
- **Field whitelist** — only `uid`, `displayName`, `photoURL`, `text`, `createdAt` are allowed

Rules only take effect once deployed (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`). See [docs/realtime.md](docs/realtime.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Design Language

The interface follows a warm editorial "field log" aesthetic — calm, readable, and purpose-built for high-stakes information.

| Element | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| **Canvas** | Parchment (`#f9f5ec`) with ink text (`#26211b`) |
| **Accent** | Single terracotta (`#b05a36`) — no gradients, no glassmorphism, no glow |
| **Display type** | Fraunces (variable serif) for headlines and scores |
| **Body type** | Karla for all running text |
| **Data type** | JetBrains Mono for numbers, IDs, timestamps, coordinates |
| **Risk colours** | Moss (low), ochre (moderate), burnt orange (high), deep red (critical) |
| **Icons** | Inline SVG with `stroke="currentColor"` and `aria-hidden="true"` — no emoji |
| **Motion** | `animate-fade-in`, `animate-slide-up`, `animate-clip-reveal` with staggered delays; all respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |

Every colour, typeface, spacing token, and utility class lives in [`src/app/globals.css`](src/app/globals.css). See [docs/design-system.md](docs/design-system.md) for the full token reference.

---

## Map

A Leaflet canvas with the standard **OpenStreetMap** basemap (with required attribution). Risk zones are rendered as GeoJSON polygons, tinted by risk level using colours from [`src/lib/risk-colors.ts`](src/lib/risk-colors.ts).

- **Layer toggle** — switch between flood, landslide, and combined overlays
- **Click to inspect** — popups show zone name, risk level, score, and description
- **Region recentering** — the map pans smoothly when switching regions
- **Client-only rendering** — Leaflet components are loaded with `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })`

> **Note**: The public OSM tile server is fine for development and demos but not for production traffic. See the [tile usage policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) and switch to a hosted provider if deploying.

---

## Environment Variables

All variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` and inlined into the client bundle at build time. Restart the dev server after changing `.env.local`.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DATA_PROVIDER` | No | `mock` | `mock` reads bundled fixtures; `api` fetches from `/api/*` route handlers |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | For `/chat` | — | Firebase web app config |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` | No | — | Unused (Analytics is not initialised) |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the template with explanatory comments. The Firebase web config is public by design — security comes from `firestore.rules`, not from hiding the config.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Next.js dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build (Turbopack) |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint (flat config) |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run test` | Run Vitest unit tests |
| `npm run docs:components` | Regenerate component API docs into `docs/components/` |

---

## Testing

Tests use **Vitest** and live in `__tests__/` directories next to the code they cover:

- [`src/lib/__tests__/`](src/lib/__tests__/) — risk scoring engine, chat message transforms
- [`src/components/insights/__tests__/`](src/components/insights/__tests__/) — insight card rendering

Vitest runs in the `node` environment (no jsdom), so realtime logic is factored into pure, SDK-free modules that can be tested without browser APIs. For example, the Firestore document → `ChatMessage` transform lives in [`src/lib/chat-messages.ts`](src/lib/chat-messages.ts) specifically so it can be unit tested.

```bash
# Run the full quality gate
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
```

Run all four before submitting changes to verify nothing is broken.

## Known Limitations

- **Sample data for most features.** Nine Kerala districts carry mock zones and alerts; the remaining regions show honest empty states. All API route handlers serve the same fixtures. Chat is the single feature backed by a real database.
- **Heuristic scoring.** Risk scores are rule-based and calibrated for demonstration, not validated forecasting. The UI makes this explicit ("model estimates for planning and training only").
- **Single chat room.** One global channel with a 120-message window. No per-region rooms, no moderation, no rate limiting, no typing indicators. See [docs/realtime.md](docs/realtime.md#known-limitations) for the roadmap.
- **No offline support.** The dashboard requires a network connection. Firestore's offline persistence is not configured.
- **Security rules are manual.** `firestore.rules` only takes effect once deployed with the Firebase CLI; `next dev` does not enforce them locally. Use `firebase emulators:exec` for local rule testing.

---

## WSL / Windows Notes

If you're developing on a Windows drive mount (`/mnt/c`):

- **`next build`** — Turbopack and Node's `copyFile` cannot write to drvfs mounts. Set `NEXT_DIST_DIR` to a Linux path:
  ```bash
  NEXT_DIST_DIR=/tmp/distraai next build
  ```
  `next.config.ts` reads this variable when set.

- **`npm install`** — Installing new packages may fail with `EPERM` on chmod of bin files. Install tooling on a non-drvfs location if needed.

For production builds, use Linux natively.
